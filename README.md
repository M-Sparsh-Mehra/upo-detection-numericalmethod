# UPO Detection in the Lorenz System (Numerical Approach)

This repository contains a complete implementation of a numerical algorithm for detecting **Unstable Periodic Orbits (UPOs)** in the **Lorenz system**, a classical example of chaotic dynamics. The approach is based on solving the periodicity condition:

\[
\phi_T(\mathbf{x}) - \mathbf{x} = 0
\]

using Newton-like methods with variational equations and constraint enforcement.
